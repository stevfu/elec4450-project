# Custom Buck Converter 
My group designed a unidirectional buck converter with an active low-pass filter and control using a C2000 microcontroller.

The following specifications for this converter are: 

$$ V_i = 36-50V$$ 
$$ V_o = 30V $$
$$ f_sw = 10kHz$$
$$\Delta I_L = 30%I_L$$
$$\Delta V_o = 0.5%V_o$$

The layout, schematic and PCB design of the buck converter was done in KiCAD.
