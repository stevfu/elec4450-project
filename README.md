# Custom Buck Converter 
My group designed a unidirectional buck converter with an active low-pass filter and control using a C2000 microcontroller.

The following specifications for this converter are: 

$$
V_i = 36\text{V} - 50\text{V}
$$

$$
V_o = 30\text{V}
$$

$$
f_{sw} = 10\text{kHz}
$$

$$
\Delta I_L = 0.3 I_L
$$

$$
\Delta V_o = 0.005 V_o
$$

The layout, schematic and PCB design of the buck converter was done in KiCAD.
